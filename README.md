## How to install

Clone and make sure you have Postgres running on your machine already. 
run rails db:create && rails db:migrate && db:seed. 
After you're finished with migrating, you can run rails s which will open an endpoint for you to fetch from at localhost:3000/api/v1/ + a path to a specifc resource. 
If you're curious as to what routes you can hit, you can run rails routes.
